        This is no ordinary path, traveler. Ahead lies uncharted lands, forgotten ruins, and trials meant for only the boldest of souls. Shadows stir, ancient forces whisper, and a dragon's roar shakes the heavens, its fiery breath a warning of what’s to come. You will battle, you will rise, and you will carve your legend into the very stone of history.
